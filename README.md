# Neural Networks

Sloppy Neural Network implementation in Ruby

This implementation is inspired by
[3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)'s
[series on Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi).

The idea is to implement a Neural Network from the ground up to completely
understand the concept and the inner workings of them.
